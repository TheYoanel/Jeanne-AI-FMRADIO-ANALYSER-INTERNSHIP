# Jeanne-AI-FMRADIO-ANALYSER-INTERNSHIP

## Summary

The project, named "Jeanne-AI-FMRADIO-ANALYSER-INTERNSHIP," aims to develop a voice assistant that operates without internet connectivity, utilizing radio waves to provide useful information to individuals in remote locations. The team chose radio due to its widespread accessibility, reliability, and capacity to transmit practical information such as weather updates and time.
